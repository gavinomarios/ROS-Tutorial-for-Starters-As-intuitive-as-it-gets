## 🧠 Introduction
ROS is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It provides tools, libraries, and conventions to simplify creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

This tutorial aims to break down the learning process into digestible sections for absolute beginners.

## 🌐 1. ROS Environment Setup
Setting up your development environment properly is the foundation for working with ROS.

### 1.1 Installing and Configuring ROS
📌 **Tutorial:** [Installing and Configuring Your ROS Environment](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment)

**Description:** 
Install ROS on your machine whatever it is
-set up environment variables
-configure your workspace

So your system is ready to develop and run ROS packages. 

ROS Packages: Self-contained and reusable modules

Including:
-Source code (Python/C++ nodes)
-Configuration files
-Launch files
-Custom messages and services
-Dependencies (other ROS packages)

## 🗂 2. ROS Filesystem & Package Management
Understand how ROS organizes files and packages—crucial for project structure and navigation.

### 2.1 Navigating the ROS Filesystem
📌 **Tutorial:** [Navigating the ROS Filesystem](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/NavigatingTheFilesystem)

**Description:** Explore ROS's file and package structure. Learn commands like `roscd`, `rosls`, and `rospack` to navigate efficiently.

### 2.2 Creating a ROS Package
📌 **Tutorial:** [Creating a ROS Package](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage)

**Description:** Understand the anatomy of a ROS package. Create your own package with dependencies, setting the stage for scalable projects.

### 2.3 Building a ROS Package
📌 **Tutorial:** [Building a ROS Package](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/BuildingPackages)

**Description:** Learn the build system (CMake/Catkin), compile your package, and resolve dependencies for smooth development.

---

## 🧠 3. Core ROS Concepts: Nodes, Topics, and Communication
Master the core communication models in ROS for inter-node messaging.

### 3.1 Understanding ROS Nodes
📌 **Tutorial:** [Understanding ROS Nodes](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes)

**Description:** Grasp the role of nodes as individual executables that handle tasks and communicate via topics and services.

### 3.2 Understanding ROS Topics
📌 **Tutorial:** [Understanding ROS Topics](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics)

**Description:** Learn about the publish-subscribe messaging model. Topics allow data streams between nodes.

### 3.3 Writing a Publisher and Subscriber
📌 **Python:** [Publisher/Subscriber in Python](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28python%29)  
📌 **C++:** [Publisher/Subscriber in C++](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28c%2B%2B%29)

**Description:** Hands-on coding to create nodes that send (publish) and receive (subscribe) data over topics.

---

## 🔄 4. ROS Services, Parameters, and Data Management
Learn synchronous communication and parameterization in ROS.

### 4.1 Understanding Services and Parameters
📌 **Tutorial:** [Services and Parameters](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingServicesParams)

**Description:** Services provide request-response communication. Parameters store runtime configurations—powerful tools for system control.

### 4.2 Creating Custom Message and Service Types
📌 **Tutorial:** [Creating Custom Msg and Srv](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv)

**Description:** Design your own data structures and services to better fit your project’s requirements.

---

## 🔧 5. ROS Tools for Debugging and Monitoring
Utilize ROS tools to manage, launch, and debug your robot system.

### 5.1 Using rqt_console and roslaunch
📌 **Tutorial:** [rqt_console and roslaunch](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UsingRqtconsoleRoslaunch)

**Description:** Learn how to monitor logs with `rqt_console`, and start multiple nodes and parameters with `roslaunch`.

---

## 🎥 6. Data Recording, Playback, and Analysis
Record and replay data for testing, debugging, and offline analysis.

### 6.1 Recording and Playing Back Data
📌 **Tutorial:** [rosbag Data Recording and Playback](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/Recordingandplayingbackdata)

**Description:** Use `rosbag` to record topic data and replay it for repeated testing or analysis without re-running the robot.

---

## 🌍 7. Advanced Concepts: Multi-Machine ROS
Scale your system by running ROS across multiple machines in a network.

### 7.1 Running ROS Across Multiple Machines
📌 **Tutorial:** [Multiple Machines Setup](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines)

**Description:** Learn network configurations that allow ROS nodes to communicate across different computers—a necessity for distributed robotic systems.
