## 🧠 Introduction
ROS is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It provides tools, libraries, and conventions to simplify creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

This tutorial aims to break down the learning process into digestible sections for absolute beginners.

---

## ⚙️ Environment Setup
- Learn how to install ROS on your system.
- Configure your workspace and environment variables.

✅ [Install & Configure ROS](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment)

---

## 🗂 Filesystem & Package Management
- Understand ROS package structures.
- Learn how to navigate the ROS filesystem and build packages.

✅ `roscd`, `rosls`, `rospack`, CMake, Catkin basics.

---

## 📡 Nodes & Topics Communication
- Learn about nodes as executables.
- Communicate between nodes using topics (Publisher/Subscriber).

✅ Includes Python and C++ examples.

---

## 🛠 Services, Parameters, and Custom Messages
- Use services for synchronous communication.
- Manage runtime configurations via the parameter server.
- Create custom messages and services.

✅ Examples included.

---

## 🔍 Debugging & Monitoring Tools
- Use `rqt_console` and `roslaunch` to monitor and debug your ROS system.

---

## 🎥 Data Recording & Playback
- Record topic data with `rosbag`.
- Play it back for testing or analysis.

---

## 🌐 Multi-Machine ROS Networking
- Learn how to distribute your ROS system across multiple machines.

✅ Network configurations and practical examples.
